# Cyber-bullying_detection
Cyberbullying Detection: Classifying the user input into "Bullying" and "Non-bullying" comments using "Supervised Learning" and "Gradio interface".

# Description
Bullying has been prevalent since the beginning of time, Itâ€™s just the ways of bullying which have changed over the years, from physical bullying to cyberbullying. Due to the massive rise of user-generated web content, particularly on social media networks, the amount of hate speech is steadily increasing. Hate speech online has been linked to a global increase in violence toward minorities, including mass shootings, lynchings, and ethnic cleansing.

This project presents a systematic review of some published research on cyberbullying detection approaches and examine methods to detect hate speech in social media, while distinguishing this from general profanity, and does a comparative study of various Supervised algorithms, including standard, as well as ensemble methods.

# Dataset
* Dataset is obtained from various platforms like Kaggle and merged into a large single Dataset.
* Data Cleaning, Preprocessing (Word Tokenization, Stemming, TF-IDF), and Resampling was done before application of any of the Machine Learning algorithms used.

# Methods Used
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* SGD Classifier
* Linear SVC
* Multinomial NB
* Random Forest Classifier

# Result
The evaluation shows that SGD Classifier and Logistic Regression worked very well as our Dataset is large and our goal is based on Classification.
